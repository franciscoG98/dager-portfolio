## Requirements

```
Hi X,

I’m looking to have a clean and simple landing page/portfolio created
my personal brand, called "Dot Dager".

The page should showcase my name, a profile picture (attached), and
give visitors a sense of my personality; like a portfolio or
introduction page. Here’s a bit about me: I’m a content creator who
loves programming, cats, guitars, pickles, and philosophy.

I don’t have specific design requirements beyond featuring my name and
profile picture prominently, but I’d love to see something that feels
like “me.” You can get creative with how you represent these
interests.

The site can be single-page, doesn't require any navigation nor
complex features (like content uploads).

Attached is my profile pic, which I use in all my socials. Aside from
this, branding and palette are to your liking.

I have a $n budget and expect to get this done in about a week.

Would this be something you'd be interested in helping me with?

Best, Mariano/Dot Dager.
